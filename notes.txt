First idea:
nameOfList.forEach(myfunction)
which is the same as

nameOfList.forEach(listItem => {
  code to execute for each listItem in nameOfList
})


Second idea:
for (let i = 0; i < nameOfList.length; i++) {
 code which does something with nameOfList[i]
}

Can also use for-loop in gnereal:
for (int i = start; test which returns true until finished; change i to get closer to finish) {
  code which inlcudes i or not
}


Object iteration first method:

v// First collect the issues in an array:
let issues = Object.keys(treatments)
// At this point, issues should be the array ["sunburn", "dehydration", "headache"]

// Then, iterate as normal:
issues.forEach(issue => {
  console.log(`If you have ${issue}, you should ${treatments[issue]}`)
 }) 
  
  
  Object iteration second method
  for (const key in nameOfObject){
    console.log(`${key} has the value ${nameOfObject[key]}`)
  }
