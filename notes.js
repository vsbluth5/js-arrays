/*
First idea:
nameOfList.forEach(myfunction)
which is the same as

nameOfList.forEach(listItem => {
  code to execute for each listItem in nameOfList
})


Second idea:
for (let i = 0; i < nameOfList.length; i++) {
 code which does something with nameOfList[i]
}

Can also use for-loop in gnereal:
for (int i = start; test which returns true until finished; change i to get closer to finish) {
  code which inlcudes i or not
}
