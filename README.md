# JavaScript Iteration Practice

This lab includes an opportunity to iterate with `for` loops. All the tasks in Part A will require a `for` loop.

JavaScript also includes some built-in methods for array iteration, and some of the most useful are:
* `.map()`, which iterates and returns a parallel copy of the array, usually modified in some way.
* `.filter()`, which iterates and returns a subset of the values in the original array.
* `.forEach()`, which iterates and returns nothing.

Feel free to do all the Part B tasks with a traditional `for` loop. If you want a challenge, you can try to use `.map()`, and for an even more significant challenge, try one of the others.

Part C includes only challenges.
