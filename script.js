console.log("Script Running!")

//// Part A: For Loops

//// SAMPLE CODE
// for (let i=0; i<11; i++){
//   console.log(i)
// }

//// 1: Console log out every number from 1-100


//// 2: Log out every number from 50-100


//// 3: Log out every even number from 1-100


//// 4 (CHALLENGE): Log out every square number from 1-225


//// 5: Log out every multiple of 3 from 1-100




//// PART B: Array Iteration

//// 6. Here's an array of all of Alex's favorite foods. For each food in the array, log out a statement that says "I really love _____" and then fill in the blank with each.
// favorite_foods = ["Sushi", "Pizza", "Salmon", "Tamales dulces", "Yuca fries", "Apple pie", "Katsu curry", "Shrimp and grits", "Waffles"]



//// 7. Now for each food in that array, let's be specific about how MUCH Alex likes them.
////    For example, log out "Alex's #1 favorite food is Sushi" and then "Alex's #2 favorite food is Pizza" and so on until you've made an ordered list.
////    This can be done a number of different ways, but the easiest is probably by iterating over each index in the favorite_foods array using a function called "range". Try to find it in the documentation.




//// 8. Below is a massive array of numbers. Iterate over the array and log out only the numbers less than 100. 
// many_numbers = [109, 141, 44, 51, 133, 366, 339, 248, 226, 321, 97, 195, 245, 252, 238, 1, 366, 47, 189, 91, 148, 88, 194, 106, 5, 128, 165, 337, 380, 181, 143, 95]



//// 9. Now iterate over that same list, but log out only the even ones. 



//// 10. Below is a array of 99 names. Iterate over them all and only log out names with more than 7 characters.
// many_names = ["Alexa","Burke","Kasimir","Baxter","Carissa","Vielka","Derek","Jemima","Jackson","Keegan","Graham","Melissa","Jeanette","Grant","Kirsten","Naida","Brody","Ishmael","Kane","Seth","Rae","Eagan","Camille","Alana",
//   "Vance","Melinda","Tarik","Risa","Jordan","Camilla","Karly","Baker","Adena","Calvin","Kendall","Nasim","Kellie","Dana","Rhoda","Linus","Tyler","Ahmed","Dante","Shay","Lael","Tana","Claudia","Chadwick","Tara",
//   "Fulton","Justine","Malcolm","Rowan","Christopher","Ciaran","Ivan","Hiram","Blake","Colton","Nathaniel","Moses","Cynthia","George","Ignacia","Chanda","Wyatt","Amethyst","Vladimir","Adam","Boris","Joseph","Scarlett","Kieran","Curran",
//   "Dalton","Paul","Phillip","Plato","Renee","Natalie","Barbara","Keiko","Oleg","Xerxes","Caesar","Kareem","Ahmed","Charles","Cyrus","Adria","Winifred","Pandora","Wynne","Simon","Wanda","Coby","Nolan","Marsden","Courtney"]




//// 11. Iterate over the many_names array and find the longest name in the whole thing.
////    Then print out "The longest name in the array is ______. It has ___ letters in it."




//// 12. Take that same array and sort it into two arrays: one array of long names, which have more than 6 characters, and one array of short names which have 6 or fewer characters. Then print out both arrays.





//// Part C: CHALLENGES:

//// 13 (CHALLENGE): Log out every number from 1-100 which is a multiple of 3 AND an even number.


//// 14 (Challenge): Log out the first 40 numbers in the fibbonacci sequence


//// 15 (Challenge): Log out the sum of every integer from 1-1000


//// 16 (Challenge): In the super long list of names, figure out if there are any doubles.
